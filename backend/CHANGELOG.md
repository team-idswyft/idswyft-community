## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Community edition first-run setup wizard — `GET /api/setup/status` and `POST /api/setup/initialize`
- Auto-detects zero-developer state, creates first account + API key without OTP
- Rate-limited setup endpoint (5 req/15min) with input sanitization

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Liveness system cleanup: removed dead MediaPipe/ActiveLiveness code path, renamed MultiFrame → HeadTurn
- Malformed `liveness_metadata` now returns HTTP 400 (`VALIDATION_ERROR`) instead of silently falling back to passive mode
- Removed legacy `multi_frame_color` challenge type alias — only `head_turn` is accepted
- `color_sequence` field is now optional (clients no longer need to send it)
- Removed deprecated `HeuristicProvider` — only `EnhancedHeuristicProvider` remains

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-19

- Visual authenticity checks — FFT analysis, color distribution, zone validation, deepfake detection
